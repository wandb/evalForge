      "The natural effect that is only visible during a total solar eclipse is the **solar corona**. The corona is the outermost layer of the Sun's atmosphere, consisting of a halo of plasma that extends millions of kilometers into space. Normally, the brightness of the Sun's photosphere (the visible surface) overwhelms the corona, making it impossible to see. However, during a total solar eclipse, when the Moon completely covers the Sun, the corona becomes visible as a faint, glowing halo around the darkened Sun. This is a rare and spectacular sight that can only be observed during a total eclipse.\n",
